Hello this project was made using react typescript, it was a 24 hour challenge between 4 of us, how it got to dragon ball, was that our first name initals were K A M and I which if as you can see can spell Kami I can't remember who but one of us was a huge dragon ball fan and recongized this overall  believe I spent 6-8 hours on this and I am still rather happy with it with the small timeline, I unfortunately could not optimize the full time limit due to unforeseen real life events, if I had more time I would have made it so that the peoples names get added to the database, and it checks for that name first so it always pulls the same power value for someone of the same name, as well as adding in a random photo to represent them, which in turn would have made it so that this person would show up on the you can beat and this person an beat you. If I did a challenge like this today I would try find an api that already had some information in it, I did do that for this project too but couldn't find anything quite right.

languages in this project are 
SQL 
React 
Typescript
Javascript
CSS
Html
I may be missing some, I did both backend and frontend of this project.


I am not able to quarentee this code is tidy I wanted to keep to the sprite of the original challenge and leave it as it was when I finished it
